/**

 * @class TwistMux
 * @brief A simple class which accepts multiple twist messages and outputs only one
 *
 * This class should act as a way to select which twist message is being sent to the robots motor controllers.  The
 * message can come from multiple places including the teleop node, the estop node (built in to this class), or the
 * autonomous node.  The twist mux will use joy messages to decide which twist message should be used at any given
 * time.
